# ⛅️ Weder

A Node.js application to work as a wrapper to OpenWeather API.

It gets weather data for "Current" and "5 day weather forecast" APIs from OpenWeather and saves the results in database.

If you're using a paid subscription from OpenWeather, then this application may not be useful to you as it calculate the registered cities count and make a `cronjob` to get requests fit in *free 60 per minute* plan.
